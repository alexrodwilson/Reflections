How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
You can concentrate your attention on a smaller area.
Really a help when the files are long.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can go back to previous versions when you break something. It is easier to find bugs when comparing a working version against a broken one. Having previous versions stored will help you to keep track of changes. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Auto-saves would not be meaningful. It would be difficult to know what version to go back to if saves happened between logical developments being finished.
Manual saves the only choice. As long as you remember to save they are the best.
