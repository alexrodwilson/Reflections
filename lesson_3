When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are ready to share your work. Or to save it in the cloud, as opposed to just having a local copy.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is when a repository is cloned onto Github's servers.
Forking can be used to allow one to work on a project when one is not on the list of approved collaborators, or to work on a project
independently so that one can take it in a direction different from that chosen by the developers.
A fork is usually used when you are developing independently, and you think it will not be appropriate to push commits to the origin.
A clone is an exact copy of a repository, all the files and its history up til that point in development.
This is the initial step before you start working on a project: you need a copy of it on your machine 
so you can start playing around with it.
A branch is a thread of development. It allows you to make a copy of the original master branch, so you can work 
on it while still preserving the original.
