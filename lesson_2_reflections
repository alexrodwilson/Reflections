What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized an empty repository is created
in the chosen folder.
You need to do this before you add files to the repository and 
the version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Allows control over what exactly to commit, to ensure that each commit is one logical change.
The working directory consists of the files that you have checked out, in the state they are currently in.
The repository is a collection of commits, containing information that allows you to revisit previous
versions of the files.
