What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized an empty repository is created
in the chosen folder.
You need to do this before you add files to the repository and 
the version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
